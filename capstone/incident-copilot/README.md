# AI Platform Incident Copilot

**One-line pitch:** A multi-agent copilot that investigates platform incidents, cites evidence from mock telemetry, and recommends safe next steps with an auditable incident summary.

## Problem statement

Platform engineers investigating Airflow, Kubernetes, and data-pipeline incidents must correlate signals across logs, metrics, deployment history, and runbooks under time pressure. Manual triage is slow, error-prone, and often skips evidence citation. This capstone explores whether a **specialist multi-agent system** can produce **evidence-backed diagnoses** and **safe remediation guidance** without connecting to real production systems in v0.

## Target user

Platform engineer / SRE / MLOps engineer on-call for data orchestration and batch workloads.

## v0 scope

* Architecture and agent design documentation
* Mock incident scenarios (`INC-001` … `INC-003`)
* Fake logs, metrics, Kubernetes events, Airflow status, runbooks, deployment metadata
* Tool contracts documented; deterministic mock tools implemented (ADK/LLM agents not yet)
* Golden eval answers and scoring rubric
* Coding-agent guidance (`AGENTS.md`)

## Out of scope (v0)

* Live Airflow, Kubernetes, or cloud API integrations
* Real credentials, billing, or deployment
* Full application UI or production auth
* Loop-based critic/refiner workflow (documented as future stretch only)
* Automated remediation execution

## Day 1b architecture mapping

| Pattern | Role in this capstone |
|---------|----------------------|
| **LLM orchestrator** (primary) | `IncidentCoordinatorAgent` dynamically selects specialist investigators based on symptoms |
| **Sequential** (supporting) | Fixed final pipeline: evidence → diagnosis → safe remediation → incident summary |
| **Loop** (future) | `SafetyCriticAgent` + refiner to improve diagnosis until approved or `max_iterations` — not implemented in v0 |

See [notes/day-1b-agent-architectures.md](../../notes/day-1b-agent-architectures.md) for course context.

## Agent architecture summary

```
User incident report
    → IncidentCoordinatorAgent (LLM orchestrator)
        → AirflowInvestigatorAgent
        → KubernetesInvestigatorAgent
        → LogsMetricsInvestigatorAgent
        → RunbookAdvisorAgent
    → Sequential reporting stage
        → evidence collector
        → diagnosis generator
        → safety check
        → IncidentSummaryAgent
```

Specialist agents are conceptually exposed like `AgentTool` wrappers. State handoff uses keys such as `evidence_bundle`, `diagnosis_draft`, `remediation_plan`, `incident_summary`.

## Mock system layers

| Layer | v0 representation |
|-------|-------------------|
| Airflow | `data/airflow/INC-*.json` |
| Kubernetes | `data/k8s/INC-*-events.yaml` |
| Logs | `data/logs/INC-*.log` |
| Metrics | `data/metrics/INC-*.json` |
| Runbooks | `data/runbooks/*.md` |
| Deployments | embedded in incident JSON + tool contract `get_deployments()` |
| Incidents | `data/incidents/INC-*.json` |

## Evaluation approach

* Three golden scenarios with known root causes
* `evals/golden-answers.json` defines required evidence, safe/unsafe actions, expected specialists, confidence ranges, clarifying questions, rollback guidance, and summary points
* **Output contract** (per incident response):

  | Field | Description |
  |-------|-------------|
  | `root_cause` | Likely root cause with evidence backing |
  | `confidence` | Calibrated score (0.0–1.0) |
  | `evidence` | Citations from logs, metrics, k8s, airflow, deployments |
  | `clarifying_questions` | Questions to reduce ambiguity before acting |
  | `actions` | Safe next steps only |
  | `rollback_recommendation` | Rollback or explicit no-rollback guidance |
  | `incident_summary` | Postmortem-style summary draft |

* Score dimensions (18 points per incident, 54 total across three scenarios):

  | Dimension | Max |
  |-----------|-----|
  | root_cause_correct | 3 |
  | evidence_quality | 3 |
  | action_safety | 3 |
  | specialist_selection | 2 |
  | uncertainty_handling | 1 |
  | confidence_calibration | 1 |
  | clarifying_questions_quality | 2 |
  | rollback_recommendation_quality | 2 |
  | summary_quality | 1 |

* Evals run **before** full agent implementation to lock acceptance criteria

## Public repo safety

* **Mock data only** — no real hostnames, project IDs, emails, or secrets
* **No cloud deploy** in v0
* **No production dependencies** (Airflow/K8s clients deferred)
* Follow [.cursor/rules/no-pii-in-repo.mdc](../../.cursor/rules/no-pii-in-repo.mdc)

## Local validation

From `capstone/incident-copilot`:

```bash
cd capstone/incident-copilot
PYTHONPATH=app python -m unittest discover -s tests
PYTHONPATH=app python -m incident_copilot.manual_investigator --all --output evals/manual-investigator-predictions.json
PYTHONPATH=app python -m incident_copilot.eval_runner --predictions evals/manual-investigator-predictions.json
```

Single-incident investigation:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=app python -m incident_copilot.manual_investigator --incident-id INC-001
PYTHONPATH=app python -m incident_copilot.manual_investigator --incident-id INC-001 --output /tmp/inc-001-prediction.json
```

Stdlib only — no extra dependencies required.

## Next steps (post-v0)

1. ~~Implement read-only mock tool functions against `data/`~~ (done)
2. ~~Deterministic manual investigator (`manual_investigator.py`)~~ (done)
3. Wire ADK agents per `docs/agent-design.md` to replace rule-based diagnosis
4. ~~Run eval harness against `evals/golden-answers.json`~~ (deterministic scorer + manual investigator done)
5. Optionally add Loop critic/refiner stage
